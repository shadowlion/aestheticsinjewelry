            <b-card-title>Retreat Stones</b-card-title>

            <b-card-text>
              Many precious stones are treated to improve appearance by oiling,
              waxing or Excel treatment. Waxing and oiling periodically will
              need to be redone as it is removed during normal cleaning
              procedures. Excel is a permanent treatment and jewelry can be
              cleaned without disturbing the process, however it can be removed
              if desired.
