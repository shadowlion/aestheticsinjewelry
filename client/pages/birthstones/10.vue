        Tourmaline is also known for displaying several colors in one gemstone.
        These bi-color or tri-color gems are formed in many combinations and are
        highly prized. One multi-color variety is known as Watermelon Tourmaline
        and features green, pink, and white color bands. To resemble its
        namesake, the gemstone is cut into thin slices having a pink center,
        white ring, and green edge.
