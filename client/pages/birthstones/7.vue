      <p>
        Ruby, the birthstone for July, is also the traditional gift for the
        fifteenth and fortieth anniversaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ruby is the red variety of corundum (Sapphire). The red in Ruby is
        caused by chromium in the crystal lattice structure of otherwise
        colorless Sapphire. It is third in hardness with a nine on the Moh scale
        (only Diamond (10) and Moissanite (9.5) are harder).
      </p>

      <p>
        Rubies are routinely heat treated to improve overall appearance of
        color, clarity, transparency and even stability. The treatment method of
        any gem should be disclosed along with any special handling requirements
        prior to purchase.
      </p>

      <p>
        Purity, and intensity of color along with clarity, size and quality of
        cut determine the value of the Ruby. One should examine and compare
        overall appearance with the unaided eye to pick the most attractive
        stone and then examine it under 10x magnification to ensure against
        durability issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ruby has long been symbolic of passion, courage, devotion, wealth and
        royalty.
