        When hearing the word Sapphire many people immediately envision a
        stunning violet-blue gemstone because the word “Sapphire” is Greek for
        blue. For centuries, the Sapphire has been referred to as the ultimate
        blue gemstone. Since Ancient times the Blue Sapphire represented a
        promise of honesty, loyalty, purity and trust. To keep with this
        tradition Sapphires are one of the most popular engagement gemstones
        today.

        Sapphire is found in many parts of the world, but the most prized
        Sapphires are from Myanmar (Burma), Kashmir and Sri Lanka. Sapphires
        with highly saturated violet-blue color and “velvety” or “sleepy”
        transparency are more rare. The purer the blue of the Sapphire, the
        greater the price. However, many people find that the darker hues of
        Sapphire can be just as appealing.

        Sapphires are not only blue, they come in almost every color of the
        rainbow: pink, yellow, orange, peach, and violet colors. The most
        sought-after color fancy Sapphire is the rare and beautiful
        Padparadscha: a pink-orange corundum with a distinctive salmon color
        reminiscent of a tropical sunset. These ultra-rare, ultra-expensive
        stones are among the most coveted gems in the world.
