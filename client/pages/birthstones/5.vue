      <p>
        Emeralds are considered the birthstone of May and a talisman for Gemini.
        They are one of the most prized of all gemstones. Since 2000BC they have
        been highly cherished as a symbol of romance, devotion, good luck and
        fortune.

        The value of any colored stone is greatly dependent upon the purity and
        intensity of its color. Fine Emerald can deliver incomparably rich green
        color. The word Emerald itself conjures up the color green.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Why Is Emerald Green?</strong></p>

      <p>
        Emerald belongs to the beryl group of minerals (Aluminum Beryllium
        Silicate). What causes Beryl (otherwise colorless) to be green and
        become Emerald is the incorporation of Chromium and or Vanadium into the
        crystal structure during formation. However, what makes Emerald green
        also stresses the crystal lattice structure. This typically causes
        fissures and minute internally healed fractures to occur in the stone
        and permeate to the surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        These may or may not be visible to the eye. They are called veils or
        inclusions, causing the internal appearance of the stone to be called Le
        Jardin or The Garden. This can be helpful in identifying the origin of
        the stone or the stone itself, like a fingerprint, if needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Emeralds are typically not eye clean and almost all are treated with
        oil, wax or resin. The value of the Emerald is not affected by the type
        of treatment, but the degree of treatment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The treatment affect is much akin to putting lemon oil or waxing a
        dulled antique piece of furniture and will be required to be done again
        from time to time. Steam cleaning, ultrasonic cleaning and jewelry
        cleaning solvent will require this to be done more frequently to prevent
        a change of appearance of the Emerald, however, there is a relatively
        new treatment that is permanent. This allows the Emerald to be used in
        an ultrasonic cleaner or light steaming.This negates the need for
        special handling and care of your Emerald. It is called Excel and it can
        be removed completely if desired.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whatever treatment an Emerald has it should be disclosed to the customer
        before the stone is purchased.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the magical things about Emerald is whether it is pale or very
        highly saturated in color, bright or muted with richness they all have
        presence and beauty that once lived with is hard to live without. They
        are very effective as remembrances to the special moments of our lives.
