        Peridot is one of the few gemstones that exists in only one color; a
        distinctive signature lime green. In ancient times it was believed that
        Peridot was a gift of Mother Nature to celebrate the annual creation of
        a new world. When presented as a gift, Peridot is said to bring the
        wearer magical powers and healing properties to protect against
        nightmares. It is also said to instill power, and influence through the
        wearing of the gemstone.

        Today, most Peridot comes from Arizona but it is also found in China,
        Myanmar, and Pakistan. Peridot is available in several colors ranging
        from yellowish green to brown, but the bright lime greens and olive
        greens are the most desired. If you prefer citrus tones or earth tones,
        youâ€™ll find that Peridot belongs in your jewelry collection.

        Peridot gemstones smaller than three carats are very common but
        gemstones over five carats are rare and therefore have a higher value.
        Peridot in 10 to 15 carats are even more rare, but provide a big and
        bold look for an affordable price.
