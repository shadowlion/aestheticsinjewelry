      <p>
        Diamond, the birthstone of April, is also the traditional tenth and
        sixtieth anniversary gift. The name diamond refers to its hardness
        (Greek - adamas: unconquerable, unbreakable). Diamonds have the highest
        scratch hardness (10) and thermal conductivity of any known material. It
        has an extremely rigid lattice structure that can only be contaminated
        by very few trace elements like boron causing blue or nitrogen causing
        yellow. Other colors (such as brown, red, pink, orange and purple) can
        be cause by patterns of interstitial vacancies (vacuoles) or lattice
        defects changing the light absorption and therefore the color. Green
        colors are cause by irradiation.

      <p>
        Colors can be changed in some types of diamonds by irradiation and/or
        heat either naturally or or color coating by man. Diamonds also can be
        lab coated in colorless or fancy colors by Chemical Vapor Deposition
        (CVD) or High Pressure/High Temperature (HPHT) methods.

      <p>
        Any time someone purchases a diamond or any gemstone, any treatments or
        special handling requires meats or whether its natural or created should
        be disclosed before it's sold.
