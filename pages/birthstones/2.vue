      <p>Amethyst (derived from Greek as "not drunken") is purple quartz.</p>

      <p>
        Amethyst, the birthstone for February, is also the traditional gift for
        the sixth and seventeenth anniversaries. Amethyst is the most highly
        prized stone of the quartz family. It has been set in many crown jewels
        and religious artifacts and was considered with the same status as
        emeralds, rubies, sapphires and diamonds for centuries. In the
        nineteenth century huge deposits were discovered in Brazil and all of a
        sudden, what once was very rare became abundant and plentiful.

        Amethyst is formed in clear quartz by introducing manganese and iron
        into the lattice structure. Depending on the iron content the amethyst
        may range from pale red violet to deep violet.

        Amethyst has a Mohs hardness of 7. They are heat treated to reduce the
        brown if present or lighten the color of very dark amethyst. If
        overheated can change to citrine or prasiolite. There is much synthetic
        Amethyst in the market which should be disclosed before purchasing a
        stone. Whether pale red violet to deep violet, Amethyst is a stone to
        marvel at when you get red, blue, and purple flashes from it.
